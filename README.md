Kubernetes, also known as K8s, is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

Kubernetes is a open-source container orchestrator

Kubernetes clusters together groups of hosts running containers, and helps you easily and efficiently manage those clusters.

### What is a Kubernetes Cluster? 
[11 Key Components](https://www.aquasec.com/cloud-native-academy/kubernetes-101/kubernetes-cluster/) 

Kubernete is a container orchestrator used to deploy, automate and manage large-scale containerized workloads. A Kubernetes cluster is a collection of nodes on which workloads can runâ€”these can be physical (bare metal) machines, or virtual machines (VMs), or serverless compute systems like Amazon Fargate. It is managed by a control plane, which is responsible for the orchestrating container activity on the nodes, and maintaining the desired cluster state.


- Open Docker > Settings > Kubernetes > tick `Enable Kubernetes` then `Apply and Restart`
- On the terminal `kubectl`
- Then check the virsion `kubectl version`
- kubectl get service `kubectl get svc`
- to DElete `kubectl delete <name>`
- `sudo kubectl create -f nginx_deploy.yml`
- `kubectl get deploy`
- `kubectl get pods`

## Its benefits
- Self Healing
- Load Balancing and Service Discovery
- Automated rollouts and rollback
- Auto Scaling
- Automatic bin packing
- Storage orchestration

### Kubernetes Architecture and Terminology
- When you deploy Kubernetes, you get a cluster.
- A Kubernetes cluster consists of a set of worker machines, called nodes, that run containerized applications. Every cluster has at least one worker node.
- The worker node(s) host the Pods that are the components of the application workload.
- A node can be either a virtual or physical machine, depending on the cluster. You'll usually have several nodes on each cluster, and on each node you'll find the kubelet, kube-proxy and container runtime.

### Load balancer
Load balancing is a straightforward task in many non-container environments, but it involves a bit of special handling when it comes to containers. There are two types of load balancing in Kubernetes 
- Internal load balancing across containers of the same type using a label, and 
- External load balancing.
